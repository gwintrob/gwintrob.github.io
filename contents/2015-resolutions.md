Rather than write down New Year's resolutions, I tend to think of general areas to improve over the following year.
Unfortunately, I'm left without any concrete, measurable improvements, so I'm going to take a different approach for 2015.
Here are two specific resolutions I'm gunning for over the next 12 months.

1. Anf&auml;nger Deutsch

   For the past two months, I've been learning German via [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/gwintrob) and [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/user/gordonw/).
   I currently know roughly 500 words and I'll write more about my motivation and techniques in a future post.
   My overall goal is to become a competent beginner German speaker by the end of 2015.

   For a concrete task, I commit to learning 125 words per month, which means I'll be on the same level as a Kindergarten student according to [this paper](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2005-03588-011).
   By the way, German "die Kinder" means "the children".

2. Create More

   It feels so good to binge watch House of Cards, read good novels, and plow through Twitter.
   [Mikael Cho](https://twitter.com/mikaelcho) provides a good summary [here](https://medium.com/@mikaelcho/create-more-than-you-consume-9c1bc89dc71d).
   As a software engineer, I'm lucky that my biggest hobby is also my line of work *and* it's a hobby with easily-shared output.

   To deliver on this goal, I'm going to write at least one article here each month for the next 12 months.
   I have a backlog of posts on startups, data science, and half-baked side projects.
   Committing to monthly writing will force me to put pen to paper with these ideas.
   If I have nothing to say for a month, then I know I'm not following through on this goal.

Also, thanks to design inspiration from my roommate [Ian Storm Taylor](http://ianstormtaylor.com/) and his open source [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) for powering this blog.
Lots of improvements to make to the site :-)
Enjoy the New Year's Eve celebrations!
