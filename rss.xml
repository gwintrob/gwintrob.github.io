With all the customer data already flowing through them, Segment is opening a powerful distribution channel for data-powered SaaS businesses.</p>
<p><img src="images/segment_integrations.png" class="img-segment-integrations"></img></p>
<p>Full disclosure &mdash; I&#39;m close with the Segment team and they were customers of my company <a href="https://stacklead.com/">StackLead</a>.
I think they&#39;re poised to win with:
an <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mll45kfhf/calvin-french-owen-25-ian-storm-taylor-25-llya-volodarsky-24-peter-reinhardt-25/">incredible team</a> with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/10/08/segment-raises-15m-for-a-customer-data-hub/">serious fundraising</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js">huge</a> <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/myth">open-source</a> <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare">contributions</a>,
and a number of important enterprise customers like Nokia and Live Nation.
Everything in this post uses public data.</p>
<h3 id="crawling-for-customer-trackers">Crawling for Customer Trackers</h3>
<p>I analyzed the <a href="https://info.crunchbase.com/about/crunchbase-data-exports/">Crunchbase Data Export</a> from December 2, 2014.
First, I filtered this data down to the 20,186 companies that have raised more than $1m USD in funding and are still operating.
Then, I crawled all of the company websites to identify the SaaS trackers they had installed.&nbsp;[1]</p>
<p>Across this set of companies, there were 895 distinct trackers (e.g.&nbsp;analytics tools, web bugs, and ad pixels) and each company used <strong>3&nbsp;trackers</strong> on average.
Traditionally, installing each of these trackers is painful, error-prone work that&#39;s pretty boring for programmers.
The Segment platform suddenly makes it possible to integrate precise tools for parts of sales, marketing, customer success, etc. without wasting valuable engineering time.</p>
<h3 id="the-tracking-landscape">The Tracking Landscape</h3>
<p>First, I looked at the number of companies that installed each of the top 10 data trackers, along with the percentage of those companies that also integrated Segment.
The top trackers are mostly free tools, so they scale for consumer products that are less likely than B2B companies to need customer-level tracking.</p>
<div id="popular-chart1" class="chart">
</div>

<p>Google Analytics dominates &mdash; nearly 13,000 companies (63% of the dataset) use the popular service, but only 224 companies in this group (2%) are also Segment customers.</p>
<p>The next 10 most popular trackers include a number of paid analytics and marketing automation products.</p>
<div id="popular-chart2" class="chart">
</div>

<p>Datapoints that jump out:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Marketo and Pardot</strong>: Only 2% of Marketo customers and 1% of Pardot customers also use Segment.
Companies that use these services are willing to pay a premium and Segment&#39;s biggest opportunity is selling into large enterprises with big integration issues.</li>
<li><strong>Mixpanel, Olark, and KISSmetrics</strong>: These are approachable tools that lots of startups love.
Segment has a solid 12-17% penetration with their customer base.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="drilling-down-by-funding">Drilling down by Funding</h3>
<p>Segment has the greatest penetration with earlier-stage companies ($1&#8209;3mm in funding) and obviously has a big opportunity to move upmarket.
Also, as these smaller companies grow, Segment is well-positioned to cater to their expanding customer data needs.</p>
<div id="funding-chart" class="chart">
</div>

<h3 id="drilling-down-by-market">Drilling down by Market</h3>
<p>The next chart shows data for the top 10 markets, sorted based on the average number of trackers used by the companies in each market.</p>
<div id="market-chart" class="chart">
</div>

<p>We see an interesting correlation: as the number of trackers per company decreases (from 6.1 for the average e-commerce website to 1.0 for biotech), Segment&#39;s penetration in the market also goes down.
Segment is increasingly valuable for industries that spend engineering effort on implementing trackers.
Importantly, these are high-growth industries like e-commerce and enterprise software that are looking to adopt new SaaS solutions.</p>
<h3 id="how-segment-is-changing-the-saas-marketplace">How Segment is Changing the SaaS Marketplace</h3>
<p>Segment&#39;s biggest impact is unprecedented distribution for new analytics tools and trackers.
For companies like <a href="http://customer.io/">Customer.io</a> and <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a>, 2/3 of their customers are also Segment users.
Here are the trackers with the highest percentage of customers using Segment:</p>
<div id="changing-chart" class="chart">
</div>

<p>Previously, integration pains were a huge barrier for new SaaS products to gain traction.
Segment is well-positioned to solve this problem and make it extremely easy for businesses (from startups to large enterprises) to mix and match their ideal customer data setup.</p>
<p>[1] You can use a tool like <a href="https://www.ghostery.com">Ghostery</a> to manually view the trackers on a site you&#39;re browsing.</p>

Unfortunately, I&#39;m left without any concrete, measurable improvements, so I&#39;m going to take a different approach for 2015.
Here are two specific resolutions I&#39;m gunning for over the next 12 months.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Anf&auml;nger Deutsch</p>
<p>For the past two months, I&#39;ve been learning German via <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/gwintrob">Duolingo</a> and <a href="http://www.memrise.com/user/gordonw/">Memrise</a>.
I currently know roughly 500 words and I&#39;ll write more about my motivation and techniques in a future post.
My overall goal is to become a competent beginner German speaker by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>For a concrete task, I commit to learning 125 words per month, which means I&#39;ll be on the same level as a Kindergarten student according to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2005-03588-011">this paper</a>.
By the way, German &quot;die Kinder&quot; means &quot;the children&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create More</p>
<p>It feels so good to binge watch House of Cards, read good novels, and plow through Twitter.
<a href="https://twitter.com/mikaelcho">Mikael Cho</a> provides a good summary <a href="https://medium.com/@mikaelcho/create-more-than-you-consume-9c1bc89dc71d">here</a>.
As a software engineer, I&#39;m lucky that my biggest hobby is also my line of work <em>and</em> it&#39;s a hobby with easily-shared output.</p>
<p>To deliver on this goal, I&#39;m going to write at least one article here each month for the next 12 months.
I have a backlog of posts on startups, data science, and half-baked side projects.
Committing to monthly writing will force me to put pen to paper with these ideas.
If I have nothing to say for a month, then I know I&#39;m not following through on this goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, thanks to design inspiration from my roommate <a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/">Ian Storm Taylor</a> and his open source <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> for powering this blog.
Lots of improvements to make to the site :-)
Enjoy the New Year&#39;s Eve celebrations!</p>
