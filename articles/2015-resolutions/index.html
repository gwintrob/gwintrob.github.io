Unfortunately, I&#39;m left without any concrete, measurable improvements, so I&#39;m going to take a different approach for 2015.
Here are two specific resolutions I&#39;m gunning for over the next 12 months.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Anf&auml;nger Deutsch</p>
<p>For the past two months, I&#39;ve been learning German via <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/gwintrob">Duolingo</a> and <a href="http://www.memrise.com/user/gordonw/">Memrise</a>.
I currently know roughly 500 words and I&#39;ll write more about my motivation and techniques in a future post.
My overall goal is to become a competent beginner German speaker by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>For a concrete task, I commit to learning 125 words per month, which means I&#39;ll be on the same level as a Kindergarten student according to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2005-03588-011">this paper</a>.
By the way, German &quot;die Kinder&quot; means &quot;the children&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create More</p>
<p>It feels so good to binge watch House of Cards, read good novels, and plow through Twitter.
<a href="https://twitter.com/mikaelcho">Mikael Cho</a> provides a good summary <a href="https://medium.com/@mikaelcho/create-more-than-you-consume-9c1bc89dc71d">here</a>.
As a software engineer, I&#39;m lucky that my biggest hobby is also my line of work <em>and</em> it&#39;s a hobby with easily-shared output.</p>
<p>To deliver on this goal, I&#39;m going to write at least one article here each month for the next 12 months.
I have a backlog of posts on startups, data science, and half-baked side projects.
Committing to monthly writing will force me to put pen to paper with these ideas.
If I have nothing to say for a month, then I know I&#39;m not following through on this goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, thanks to design inspiration from my roommate <a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/">Ian Storm Taylor</a> and his open source <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> for powering this blog.
Lots of improvements to make to the site :-)
Enjoy the New Year&#39;s Eve celebrations!</p>
